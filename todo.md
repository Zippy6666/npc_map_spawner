# Todo
- [ ] Despawn probably
- [ ] Filter out node positions (under water or flying ones for example)
- [ ] Reset settings button
- [ ] Spawn areas that affect the note positions
- [ ] Ability to write lua code on the npcs in-game (and maybe a simpler version that just allows you to input method names, and arguments, such as SetHealth and Give etc)
- [ ] An option called "Group allies", it will cause allies to teleport to each others proximity and join each others squad
- [ ] Zones that will change where NPCs can spawn, should affect the node table directly
