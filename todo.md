# TODO


# Ideas
- No distance check option
- Despawn/teleport
- Ability to write lua code on the npcs in-game (and maybe a simpler version that just allows you to input method names, and arguments, such as SetHealth and Give etc)
- An option called "Group allies", it will cause allies to teleport to each others proximity and join each others squad
- Zones that will change where NPCs can spawn, should affect the node table directly
- Sleep states
